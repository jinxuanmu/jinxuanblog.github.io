Hi, I am Jin, a product manager with more than ten years of experience in the tech industry. During my past experience, I served three tech companies in the gaming, social, and e-commerce sectors. You might have heard of one of them, and that's Tencent.
 
When I worked as Senior Product Manager at Tencent, I was responsible for three products within Qzone, one of the biggest social networking platforms similar to Facebook. These products enable users to explore the virtual world, make friends, and have fun in a more efficient way. As a PM, except for iterating new features, enhancing user experience, and bug fixing, I planned the product operation strategy to improve user engagement. I launched a series of online events related to festivals. These online events help users celebrate festivals in an impressive way, bringing surprises and happiness to them. Also, I initiated the trending topics & events project by leveraging the basic functions of products, allowing users to express their opinions and emotions on popular topics on the platform. 

Apart from my role as a PM, I had an opportunity to focus on the marketing areas, allowing me to gain cross-area capabilities, and think from product, operation, marketing, and business strategy standpoints. I used to be the marketing manager of Tencent Animation and Comics platform, the biggest animation and comics platform in China. By taking advantage of the product, PR, ads, media, BD, and co-branding resources, I planned several integrated marketing campaigns to increase new adopters and brand awareness. Using AR technology, I showed 3D comic characters on the Lunar New Year gala stage to attract new adopters and improve brand exposure. I planned offline anime conventions, where cosplayers will perform and interact closely with fans. Also, I collaborated with celebrities beloved by our potential target users, inviting them to be our brand ambassadors, significantly increasing awareness and favorability towards our product among users.

Beyond my daily work, I had the privilege of volunteering as a marketing specialist for Tedx. Collaborating with other talented volunteers, we successfully organized TedxTencent in 2016. Through years of relentless dedication and focus in my work, I've continuously accumulated experience from project practices, refining my mindset and honing my skills. 

Fortunately, In 2021, I got a Full-time MBA offer and moved to NYC to start my student life. It is a really impressive journey. I have met many excellent professors and made nice and talented friends from various countries around the world. Despite the huge academic and financial pressures over these two years, it has been challenging yet enriching.

I graduated in May 2023 which is called the most challenging job market for graduates due to the covid. Luck was on my side once again. After six months of job hunting and sending out hundreds of resumes, I finally landed a job two months after graduation, and now I work as a PM at a startup company located in the Bay area.

I never dreamt of becoming a big shot. Working with talented individuals to create valuable products excites me. Planning passionate and creative marketing campaigns also brings me fulfillment. I like drinking. I imagine relaxing by a fireplace on snowy days with a drink. I desire more time to practice guitar and restart learning boxing. I also want to dive, ski, surf, and travel to capture beautiful moments with a camera. 

I believe that regardless of whether you're introverted or extroverted, whether you're an 'I' or an 'E' in the MBTI, everyone ultimately needs to find a way to connect with the world. This blog serves as my means of connection with the world. Here, I'll share my thoughts and insights about work and life. It would be my honor and joy if every visitor to my blog could gain some value from it.
