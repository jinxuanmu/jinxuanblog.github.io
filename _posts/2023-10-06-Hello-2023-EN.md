After intermittently working on GitHub for four months, during which I went through a challenging job search, relocated to a new city, started my career at a new company, and successfully passed the probation period, my blog was finally released.


In China, people are used to creating a subscription account on WeChat to write a blog.  I pushed myself to create one and updated blogs at a lower frequency, around one time three months. The topics were related to work, study abroad, and personal reflections. Surprisingly, my blog got a great performance because of support from my WeChat friends. Most of my followers are my WeChat friends， and when I updated blogs, they thumbs up, reposted, and even donated, bringing me a huge motivation to keep updating. The only regret is that the blog was launched too late, resulting in no comment function as WeChat's official restricted the comment function due to the China internet regulation policy from a few years ago. So I cannot interact with friends in my blog.


A few years later, I moved to America to study and work. I surprisingly found that, even though it is already the mobile internet era, lots of Americans still keep the habit of using laptops. Compared to the frenzy of mobile internet in China, traditional internet tools, such as websites and emails, are still an important means of communication. People would like to use them to run personal websites, design work portfolios, run a small e-commerce business, and record themselves through website blogs which is an old-fashioned way in my mind.


One of the reasons I thought the blog is an old-fashioned way is China experienced a short period time of Web 1.0 and mobile Internet takes up almost half of my life. Compared to the United States where the Internet emerged as early as the 1960s and entered into the public eye in the 1990s, China only connected to the Internet in 1994 and the iPhone entered the Chinese market in 2019. Web 1.0 had only developed over a decade in China. User education, such as user habits, awareness of payments, and copyright consciousness, hasn't matured as it has in the American market. Despite this, China swiftly transitioned into the mobile internet era within a very short time.

In China today, apart from work-related scenarios, people primarily rely on smartphones instead of laptops for various aspects of life, such as social networking, shopping, gaming, entertainment, and more. Sending emails outside of work situations was rare. This is one of the big reasons email marketing isn't popular in China. So, when I came to America, I felt inconvenienced as I often needed my laptop. Email was a wespride tool in both professional and personal settings. 

As I gradually adapted to life in America, I liked this "less convenient" way. We always hope to do things faster and faster in China, but now, opening the laptop forces me to slow down and have more patience while browsing complex information. Even outside work, I need to respond to messages and emails more thoughtfully. Also, when I was a student in New York, I found some professors had their blogs. I noticed lots of people show themselves through blogs when I searched on the internet or socialized with them. A blog is one of the preferred ways to keep a connection with the world, which inspired me to build up my blog as well.

I explored several blog template websites, such as Wix and WordPress, which are really good website builders and user-friendly for non-coding people. However, as a quite picky product manager, I still feel not customized and unique enough for me. I can not design any function I need based on templates.

Until one day， I was in the Web Analytics class, the professor asked us to practice crawling on his blog. I liked his blog style which is simple, functional, and completely different from what I have seen on Wix and WordPress. I sent an email to the professor to ask how to build a blog like his. He introduced me to GitHub and briefly shared the process of building a similar blog. I heard of GitHub before but never explored it. I immediately signed up for an account on GitHub. I found there are so many beautiful templates on Jekyll which are open resources and anyone can customize the blog template based on the code provided. I really like it and was so excited to start building my blog by Jekyll.

To be honest, I am not a coding guy. I only know Python and MySQL. There is a saying that ignorance breeds fearlessness. I stepped into the world of GitHub without hesitation and made it happen with strong execution. I explored Jekyll and selected a template, and then I read the manual and learned to understand the structure and configuration of the website。 I installed Ruby, Gem, and Jekyll, enabling me to configure, and directly test the website in the local environment. During the process, I encountered various technical challenges and sought solutions by using Google and asking ChatGPT.

Finally, after multiple tests, I made it. Although I did not completely understand many technical details of this website and the current website is mostly basic configuration based on existing code, 
I am fine with it. As version 1.0, the MVP version, it meets my needs for now. I know there is still some room for improvement. For example, on the home page, once the title text exceeds a certain limit, it automatically wraps to a new line, causing the background image to stretch. Additionally, on the article page, despite numerous attempts, I haven't been able to figure out how to configure a separate language selector for each post. No worries. I can iterate and enhance my website in the future based on Jekyll's powerful flexibility. Releasing it, getting feedback from the real world, and then iterating it is an important lesson I learned when I first became the PM.

I hope I can leverage the blog to keep thinking, reflecting, and practicing English writing skills. As a native Mandarin speaker, I've been learning Mandarin since birth. Decades of Mandarin experience allow me to easily handle various Chinese communication situations, choosing more appropriate vocabulary and nuances, and decently joking with each other without offence. However, even though I started learning English in middle school, I've only been using English as a primary language for life and work for about three years. In many situations, I can distinctly feel that my English communication skills are much less skillful. Learning is a lifelong thing, not only in Mandarin, but English. I hope I can enhance my English writing skills through writing the blog,


Last, I also hope I can keep a connection with the world through the blog. I don't remember where I saw the image below, but I want to share it with you. I have tried my best to translate it for you to deliver the most proper meaning of the sentence. Hope in the future I can keep a connection with the world not only through writing but also speaking.

> Writing and speaking are the two ways to expand your influence. If you are a low-profile person, write. If you are a high-profile person, speak. In this era, don't use obscurity and diligent hard work as excuses, or let them trap you in endless labor, hindering your impact on the world.


I always believe the nature of the internet is open and connection. Thanks to the internet for giving me a chance to keep a connection with the world and others. Thanks to GitHub for the open-source spirit so that I can benefit from the work of others.

Hope everyone who comes to my blog will enjoy the product and content.
