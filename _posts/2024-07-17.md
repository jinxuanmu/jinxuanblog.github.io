Last year, the job market was quite challenging, but I was fortunate enough to land an opportunity at a startup company as a product manager. It's been a year since then. Compared to my previous experience at a big tech company, working in a startup has been a great chance for learning and hands-on practice. 

Although I can only practice and observe from the perspective of an employee rather than a founder who invests money into the business, it's quite rare for me to stand beside the founders and think, feel, and practice alongside them.


I've had the chance to participate not only in high-level activities like planning business strategies but also in more basic projects such as managing products and driving marketing campaigns. This has allowed me to gain a holistic picture of the business. Especially when we encountered issues related to business strategy, even though I didn't have the power to make decisions, I kept thinking, "If I were the one in that position, how would I handle these issues?"

My motivation for doing this is to practice the ability to understand the nature of problems and find a direction and solution in complex situations with various distracting factors. By improving my cognitive abilities, I hope that one day, I can do something small but meaningful with a few friends. We can not only improve our own lives but also provide value for others. I believe that would be truly something to be proud of.

Now, I'd like to share some reflections based on my one-year experience at a startup. Maybe when I look back on these ideas after a few months or years, I'll think they were naive. No worries, it's just part of the growth process.


# 1. Core belief: the foundation of success.

Early in my career, I didn't pay much attention to concepts like mission and vision. I saw them as mere buzzwords, useful for storytelling, PR, or attracting investors rather than driving real business. My focus was solely on product and marketing However, my perspective has evolved in recent years.

This time around, I want to avoid the terms "mission" and "vision" because they are often misunderstood or misdefined. The term used isn’t what matters; what’s important is clearly articulating the core questions we need to answer. I would like to use the term "core value" which is from a speech I watched recently. This resonated with me because core values are an extension of core beliefs and are more specific than core beliefs. 

**So the key question is: What is the core value you always believe you or your team provide?** This value could be monumental or modest. You could aim as high as Elon Musk, with aspirations to help humanity colonize Mars and create a new habitable planet. Or, it could be as straightforward as improving the user experience of a power strip so that using one socket doesn’t block another.

Defining the core value is also crucial for determining what not to do. Both companies and individuals have limited resources. **Understanding your limitations-what you can not do, is more important than knowing what you can do.** Otherwise, it's easy to be swayed by money and other distractions. shifting from being value-driven to money-driven. Being money-driven isn't necessarily a bad thing, the problem lies in the inconsistency between words and actions—proclaiming value-driven goals while performing money-driven actions.

Once you've identified your core value, commit to it for one year, two years, three years... As long as you persist and remain resilient, you’ll eventually see a good return. **And as for wealth, it should be seen as a bonus or by-product of doing the right thing.**


# 2. During the Stage from 0 to 1, the "Business Model Canvas" is essential.

Actually, using quotation marks around "Business Model Canvas" isn’t to highlight the significance of this model; rather, I want to highlight the specific approach to thinking. The Business Model Canvas, like other frameworks we learn in business or marketing courses—such as SMART, PESTLE, or Porter’s Five Forces—represents a method of systematic thinking. Merely memorizing these models serves little purpose.   

Each element of the Business Model Canvas encourages logical and comprehensive thinking about business like users, value propositions, key activities, key stakeholders, costs, and revenues. **The primary goal of using the Business Model Canvas is to emphasize the thought process rather than just filling it out.** When you’ve carefully considered each element of the canvas, you’ll likely have answered the critical questions about your business. At that point, you can set it aside, having internalized its insights.


# 3. The strategy should match the business.

Perhaps due to my work in the tech industry and my current location in the Bay Area, I’ve noticed that many people who venture into entrepreneurship or join startups come from big tech companies. However, the business models in their new ventures often differ significantly from those of their previous employers.

In a tech company, particularly in the early stage from 0 to 1, the business strategy is almost synonymous with the product strategy. Key activities typically include identifying new or niche markets, targeting specific user segments, designing valuable and user-friendly products to attract early adopters, and then scaling and monetizing the product. These tasks are critical to the company’s success.

However, for startups that integrate technology but also rely heavily on a combination of online and offline services to deliver value, the strategy diverges significantly. In these cases, providing a valuable online product is just one of the key actions. The business strategy and product strategy are distinct and must be treated as such. A tech-driven or product-driven approach, often championed in tech companies, may not be suitable for these types of businesses.

**Therefore, it is essential to avoid the trap of conventional thinking and to respect objective facts and basic rules.** Each business requires a tailored approach that aligns strategy with its unique needs and circumstances.


# 4. Vibe matters.

In a startup, the team might be small, but its quality should be exceptionally high, often even higher than that in big tech companies. Talented individuals attract other talented individuals, so it's crucial for startups to recruit "real adults".

When everyone on the team shares a similar level of knowledge and cognitive capability, there's no need to waste time on basic education, explaining fundamental concepts and logic. They can engage in positive debates without worrying about emotional outbursts or office politics. This intellectual clash fosters a stimulating and motivating work environment.

However, startups usually encounter the challenge of needing staff urgently but struggling to find suitable candidates. What should you do when you can't find those A players quickly? I don't have a definitive solution right now, but I can offer two tips:

First, talented individuals don’t necessarily come from big tech companies. Talent means having the skills to solve problems, including specific professional expertise, cognitive abilities, the capacity to understand the essence of a problem, quick learning skills, communication skills, collaboration abilities, and strong execution power. These individuals might come from big companies, which often have rigorous hiring processes that screen for these qualities. However, they are smart people, but not necessarily excellent ones.

I've come across several people from big tech who were mediocre in terms of ability but had developed workplace survival skills and office politics skills. Of course, many disliked these skills but had to adapt due to the culture and competitive forces. Once out of such environments, they should have the self-awareness to discard these unwanted "skills."

Additionally, some individuals from big companies inherently have poor values. They might be the type to curry favor with superiors and look down on others. When they join a smaller company, they often adopt a superior attitude, treating colleagues condescendingly. This behavior can severely damage a startup's culture and work environment.

I have a fairly reliable method for identifying such individuals: When I go out to eat with someone I have a working relationship with, I observe how they treat the restaurant staff. If they show impatience or disrespect towards servers, there's a high probability they possess these negative traits.

Second, I would suggest the startup's interviewers maintain basic etiquette, respect, time management, and high-quality conversations during interviews. This ensures that candidates feel, despite the company's small size, the people here are reliable and professional. Whether or not they decide to join, leaving a positive impression and building a good reputation will benefit to the company. Startups have limited resources, so don’t miss any opportunity to market yourselves. Moreover, no one wants to be distracted by crisis management at this stage, right?

The final point I'd like to address under this topic is culture. It's essential to truly understand the essence of your business. You need to motivate your team members to achieve the business goals. To do this, you must recognize what you should provide them to enable effective value delivery to your customers.

**Remember: if you want to give something, you must have it first.** If you want to donate, you need to have money first. If you want to spend time with family, you need to have available time first. Similarly, if your business aims to bring happiness or care to customers, you need to ensure your team members feel that happiness and care first.

In essence, your internal culture should reflect and support the value you aim to provide externally.


# 5. Focus and execute your core responsibilities.

In a startup, with limited resources, it's crucial to focus all resources, including both financial and human resources, on a single, unified goal. 

Like a ship navigating rough seas or a sports team on the field, different roles should contribute to a common objective. While growth and revenue are key metrics for C-level managers, who are generally pleased to see these indicators rise, turning everyone into a salesperson isn't efficient. This approach can lead to high risks and inefficiencies. In any team, diverse roles are essential:

* In a fleet, you need helmsmen, sailors, and navigators.
* In basketball, you need shooters, defenders, and playmakers.
* In an e-sports MOBA team, you need to carry, support and tank roles.
* In a startup, you need sales, product development, and support roles.

C-level executives should avoid pressuring teams beyond their designated roles. Team managers must be confident about the value of their specific contributions. **Achieving business goals requires each team to focus on its responsibilities rather than drifting into others' roles.**

Maintaining this focus is challenging but crucial. Losing balance leads to inefficiency and negates the benefits of role specialization. It's about respecting and maintaining diverse roles, even under pressure for immediate results.
The key to startup success lies in creating a well-orchestrated team where each member excels in their specific role, all working towards the common goal.


# 6. Everyone should be "full stack" in a startup.

In the dynamic environment of a startup, roles often need to be fluid and multifaceted. This is why being "full stack" - capable of handling multiple aspects of the business - is crucial.

In the early stages of a startup, managers who are solely responsible for overseeing teams are not must-have positions. Once the business goal is set, it can be divided into several key strategies or actions necessary to achieve it. Each team is then responsible for handling these key strategies or actions based on their specific roles. Within each team, these strategies or actions can be further broken down into individual projects.

Senior-level members should not only possess leadership skills, project management abilities, and the capability to integrate and allocate resources, as well as present to C-level managers, but they should also have the capability and willingness to contribute hands-on to the tasks at hand. In this context, a manager who only oversees the team without contributing directly becomes less valuable.

This highlights a key difference between big tech companies and startups. While large companies often look for specialists who can be excellent at a specific role, startups require versatile individuals—"full stack" to a certain degree. Everyone needs to be capable of handling multiple roles and responsibilities to move the startup forward.

In essence, the success of a startup often depends on having team members who can adapt, learn quickly, and contribute across various areas of the business. This "full stack" mentality ensures that the limited human resources in a startup are utilized to their fullest potential.


# 7. Sustained and stable growth is a valuable and rare state worth pursuing

In the world of startups, there's often a misconception that success comes in the form of explosive, overnight growth. However, the reality is quite different.

In my experience, I can't recall any product or business that suddenly became a sensation overnight. Most products or businesses endure a period of obscurity before gaining recognition. Think of a little sapling you might have passed on your way to work or home countless times without noticing. One day, you suddenly realize how tall and impressive it is, even though it has been growing steadily all along.
Don't always expect or chase after sudden explosive growth. Such occurrences are often unpredictable and beyond human control. If you do experience it, consider yourself fortunate.

**Before that stroke of luck comes, focus on honing your basic skills and keeping your nose on the ground doing what needs to be done. Strive for sustainable and stable growth.** If your business can consistently grow by even 1% each year and survive for three, five, or ten years, it's a remarkable achievement. 


# 8. Be enthusiastic and rationality attitude toward new technology

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all the rage these days. It’s essential to learn about it, understand it, and experiment with it. However, it’s equally important to maintain a rational attitude when considering how to integrate AI into your business.

I’ve noticed that some people are so eager to jump on the AI bandwagon that they rush into it without fully understanding what it is or why their business needs it. This eagerness often resembles a frantic rush to secure a "ticket" on the next generation of the internet ship, fearful of being left behind. Or, they might also be trying to shape their team's image as innovative and cutting-edge, striving to be seen as part of the future.

**But it's important to remember that we should not allow the passionate pursuit of advanced technologies to overshadow the laziness in strategic thinking.** Regardless of the technology, our ultimate goal is to deliver valuable products and services to our target users. New technologies like AI are just one of many potential solutions and might not always be the best fit. The real issue might not be a lack of cutting-edge technology but rather wavering strategies, poor execution, or a failure to identify user needs.

I came across a saying online that I’d like to share with you:

> Entrepreneurs should always stay attuned to new technologies but remember this: don’t overestimate their impact in the short term and don’t underestimate their impact in the long term.




# 9. Execution is what sets businesses apart

In both China and America, especially in hubs like Shenzhen and the Bay Area where talent thrives, creativity and ideas abound. While your team is still enthusiastic about chasing big ideas, another team might already be executing a few ideas that are not as brilliant or creative but seem good enough to be worth trying. They might have already developed an MVP, received market feedback, and continuously iterated and adjusted.

During my tenure as a marketing manager, I learned a valuable lesson: **If a creative idea does not serve the strategy, it holds little significance beyond personal satisfaction for its creator.** Therefore, I suggest reducing unnecessary brainstorming. Instead, start by clearly planning the strategy. Then, when faced with a specific problem lacking solutions, brainstorming can be used effectively to generate ideas and drive solutions forward.

In fact, when facing a problem, multiple solutions often present themselves. Each solution comprises an objective and subjective component. The objective part is grounded in research, data analysis, and scenario planning, determining the solution's feasibility. In contrast, the subjective part is influenced by the business owner's style; there's no definitive right or wrong. For example, individuals with diverse backgrounds, such as technical or sales, may propose distinct yet equally effective solutions to the same issue. So, which option should we choose at this moment? In my view, either option works. The key is swift decision-making and action. Startups excel in pivoting swiftly, avoiding the cumbersome decision-making processes typical of larger corporations.

During this process, I also observed another phenomenon: someone prioritizes their ideas above business success. While undoubtedly passionate and proactive about the business, their focus remains on whether the team adopts their ideas. My suggestion is not to be discouraged if your idea is not adopted, and refrain from repeatedly trying to convince others. Instead, enjoy the process of exploration with your team, embracing both successes and failures. We should understand that in life, true persuasion is rare in your life; more often, what you perceive as persuasion is simply the other party yielding voluntarily or under the pressure of authority.


The last point I want to discuss is the quality of execution. A team that can execute a strategy to 80% effectiveness is already excellent and rare.

To be honest, compared to pairing a first-class idea with a team with average execution capability, I prefer pairing a second-class idea with a team with excellent execution capability. Different teams executing the same idea yield varying outcomes.

Effective execution isn't about overtime but meticulous adherence to plans, attention to detail at each step, timely execution, and continuous performance monitoring. Retrospection is crucial—learning from each project to improve future actions.

As the saying goes:
> The devil is in the details, and details are from execution.

The second sentence is my creation. :)

 
# In closing

All the above is my reflection on my one-year experience in a startup. Even though I try my best to think from a different perspective, which is a must-have skill PM should have, it is still different. When I truly sit in that shoe in the future, my mindset may be different due to the pressure from stakeholders and other unexpected factors.

As founders, their real world is the company's operating costs are certain every minute, but the revenue is uncertain. However, as employees, every minute we spend in the company is predictable, and our monthly income is fixed.

Wishing you all success.
