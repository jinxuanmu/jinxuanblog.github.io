AI has been a hot topic for a while now. However, what I feel more is the blind pursuit of AI by individuals or teams, rather than thinking from the perspective of business value and user value. **AI can be a solution, but it cannot solve laziness in thinking and roughness in execution.**

I'm definitely thrilled about AI personally, but alongside that excitement, I also find myself exercising more caution and conservatism at this stage, which doesn't match the prevailing sentiment. I'm not resistant or fearful of AI.  I just lean towards seeking a more efficient way to get first-hand knowledge about AI. You can register accounts on various AI platforms to get hands-on experience, attend Stanford's open courses, or learn AI systematically on GitHub. Also, listening to speeches and interviews from industry leaders in AI can provide valuable insights. **I believe that gaining a solid understanding of AI is essential before deciding how best to utilize it to deliver value to users or enhance my efficiency.**

Now, I want to share three videos from the AI industry leaders： NVIDIA CEO Jesane Huang, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and YC China founder Qi Lu.

What's intriguing is that I spotted some common ground among the insights shared by these three speakers. Instead of summarizing their viewpoints here, I'd recommend checking out the videos yourselves. 

While watching Qi Lu's video, it suddenly sparked some thoughts on another topic for me. He talked about how the human brain is divided into System 1 and System 2. I guess that this theory might be from Daniel Kahneman's book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. Coincidentally, I read that book last year, so if my guess is on point, I might have a grasp of what Qi Lu was aiming to communicate. I suppose there might be some audience members who aren't familiar with this theory. Never mind, we all have blind spots in knowledge. I just happen to know about it.

At that moment, I suddenly thought of a topic that we often discuss: whose responsibility is it if the audience doesn't understand a speech— the speaker's or the audience's? I once came across an opinion: it is definitely the speaker's responsibility. The responsibility of the speaker is to ensure that all present audience members understand what they are trying to convey. Therefore, speakers must continuously refine their speech content and strive to make it as easy as possible for the audience to understand within the limited time available.

I've always embraced this viewpoint. So whenever I have my own 'speaking' tasks which are mostly presentations for projects at my company, I make every effort to thoroughly organize the content from thin to thick, and then refine it from thick to thin.  I try to think from the audience's perspective and make it as easy as possible for them to understand. Unfortunately, I'm actually not very skilled at this. So, I still often struggle to do it well. This often leads me to question myself: Am I speaking too quickly? Are my points not clear enough? Is my logic not well-structured? Am I using terms audiences are unfamiliar with? These doubts can bother me for days afterward.


However, it wasn't until recently, when I watched videos featuring these industry leaders, that I realized some people might not understand certain points they were making. Interestingly, rather than faulting the speakers for unclear communication, many viewers tend to attribute it to their knowledge gaps and promptly seek out related concepts. 

I suddenly realized that we may have a bit of a double standard when it comes to the relationship between speakers and audiences. When the speaker is someone like our colleagues or an ordinary person without fame, if we don't understand, we tend to think it's due to the speaker's lack of communication skills or depth of thought. We might even lack the patience to continue listening. However, if the speaker is a celebrity, we tend to attribute our lack of understanding to our own knowledge shortcomings. Even if we don't understand, we desperately try to keep up with them. Realizing this makes me feel a sense of sadness.

So now I have a new perspective on the question of whether it's the speaker's responsibility or the audience's responsibility if the audience doesn't understand a speech. **My viewpoint is: A quality speech requires teamwork between a responsible speaker and a qualified audience.** The speaker should take responsibility for delivering insightful viewpoints, clear logic, adept communication skills, and audience engagement. Meanwhile, the audience should possess the fundamental knowledge necessary to comprehend the speech.

Only when both parties are operating at a relatively consistent level can a meaningful exchange of ideas take place and spark intellectual insights.
