This week, a blog by Paul Graham on the concept of Founder Mode vs. Manager Mode has been making waves. I’ve read it several times, and while Paul Graham mentioned that the idea of Founder Mode is still relatively unfamiliar to many, I strongly agree with its core message, especially when it comes to startups.

Before encountering Paul Graham’s blog, I had already been contemplating writing something about manager responsibility. I’ve often thought about the question: Why is it necessary to have one, or even several managers, between the founder and the project team members? If the founder isn’t familiar with the project’s progress and details, how can they make the right decisions? Since I couldn’t find a clear answer, I thought, "Well, if Manager Mode is still the dominant way of managing, let’s focus on how we can become better managers." And that’s how this blog came about.

In a world where Manager Mode remains the mainstream, let’s look at it from a personal perspective: If you're not running your own business and are working for someone else, promotion is an inevitable topic when considering your career development. But before you’re promoted to a manager, I’m very curious—what is your motivation for becoming a manager?

Is it vanity? Status? The high salary? The thrill of sitting in meetings with senior executives? The flattery and compliments from colleagues? The idea that you no longer have to do the "dirty work"? Or perhaps, you want a more relaxed job, where you no longer need to be hands-on and can simply comment or critique others' work?

It’s worth taking a moment to ask yourself these questions. Be honest and give yourself a truthful answer.

These motivations are part of human nature, and there’s no need to feel ashamed if you identify with them. I’ve observed and experienced some managers, and their behaviors often reveal that these reasons are indeed the primary drivers behind their decision to become managers.

I’ve been a manager myself. I won’t deny that a higher salary was one of my motivations, though not the first one. However, vanity, status, flattery, and avoiding dirty or hands-on work were never factors in my decision.

My main motivation for becoming a manager is to create value, followed by the financial rewards I deserve. I’ll explain creating value from two perspectives:

First, I want to create more value for users. To do that in Manager Mode, I need to become a manager—or even attain a higher position—so that I can leverage more resources to accomplish more.

Second, I want to create value for my team members, who are my internal users. I believe I have the ability and willingness to take responsibility for more people. Taking responsibility doesn’t mean managing them—it means working alongside them and providing support when necessary. I want to help them by valuing their time and effort and making the most of it. I aim to make their work more meaningful, fulfilling, and financially rewarding so they and their families can live better lives. To me, there’s nothing more exciting and gratifying than helping team members realize that their work truly adds value for users and that their hard work genuinely benefits their own and their families' lives. This is the same feeling of excitement I get when providing real value to external users by meeting their needs.

In fact, this second point sounds more like the leadership role of a project owner rather than a manager. I enjoy working alongside team members to achieve results, rather than standing on the sidelines giving comments and critiques. But within Manager Mode, becoming a manager makes it easier for me to create value for them.

To become even a minimally competent manager—let alone an excellent one—I think we need two key factors: motivation and management skills. There’s already plenty of content online discussing leadership and management skills, which covers the second factor. However, if a person’s initial motivation is purely driven by personal gain, I believe it’s difficult for them to create the true value of being a manager. Of course, I’m not saying that anyone who becomes a manager needs to be a saint, free from any selfish thoughts. Most people are still driven by self-interest, and it’s natural to be motivated by vanity, status, or avoiding dirty or hands-on work. However, these should not be the sole reasons for becoming a manager.

I'm not here to narrowly argue that my perspective is the only correct one. Instead, I'm just sharing a Manager Mode approach that I have experienced and found to be very effective for me. My previous managers used this approach, and when I became a manager, I adopted this way of working with my team members. Of course, if I ever get the opportunity, I would be more than willing to experiment with Founder Mode. Whether for the founder or the team members, I believe Founder Mode could be a more efficient approach, especially for startups.

Lastly, I’d like to share a quote from Spider-Man with all managers or potential managers, whether you’re the Head, Director, VP, or C-level: "With great power comes great responsibility."
